# Light Effects

Platform independent implementation of light effects for LEDs.

This component was tested with [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) **v4.1**.

This is a *work-in-progress* and should be tested before use.

## Tests

I will use it with:

- ESP32-DevKitC
- pax-LampD1
- pax-DLED

## Development Environment

Currently uses the latest stable version of [Espressif IoT Development Framework](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf), v4.1 as of December 2020.

Editing was done in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

Version control with [Git](https://git-scm.com).
